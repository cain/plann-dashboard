# Plann Dashboard Project

Task:

Plann is introducing a new dashboard page in 2021. Included in the design folder is a simplified example of the layout. Please build a VueJS app that includes a page with this layout.

Figma link to the design: https://www.figma.com/file/qGa30JecDkV1ioQ5468ogJ/Jan-2022?node-id=0%3A1

Requirements:

1.) The app needs to request the TODO items from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos to populate the list on the right hand side of the page. Display the 'title' field from the responses as the main body text for the todo item. Please show the first 5 items from the response.

2.) Please commit your VueJS app code to a public repository such as Github so we can build the project locally and review.

3.) You can use a CSS framework if you like (we use Bulma at Plann) although we also like to see that you can custom code css when needed.

4.) Code comments on custom javascript is encouraged.



We have included some assets in this folder to help assist you build the project.
